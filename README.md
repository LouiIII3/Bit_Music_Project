## Usage

- Integrating Vue in Spring Boot:

    To neatly organize the Vue project, create a `vue` folder inside your Spring Boot project as follows:

    ```sh
    mkdir vue
    ```

    Running this command will create the `vue` folder. Now navigate to the created folder to configure the Vue project:

    ```sh
    cd vue
    ```

    To create the Vue project, run the following command:

    ```sh
    vue init webpack vue-front
    ```

    This will create the Vue project.

- Installing the Tensorflow module:

  To install the Tensorflow module, use the following command:

  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow

## Additional Features

#### 1. Token Implementation

- Token-based registration enhances authentication and security, facilitates stateless architecture, separates infrastructure components, improves user experience, and enables consistent authentication across applications.

#### 2. Direct Login and Registration Implementation in V1 Version

- Decided to implement the login and registration functions directly without relying on frameworks like Spring Security. This is to gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts and working principles.
- By directly exploring various security and authentication technologies, we aim to broaden our understanding of different technologies and advance our technical stack.

#### 3. Deep Learning Environment Setup According to Model API (2024-02-11)

- Set up a deep learning environment according to the Model API to enhance exercise data analysis and prediction capabilities. This allows users to receive more sophisticated and customized exercise plans.

#### <s>4. Camera Heart Rate Measurement (2024-02-11)</s>

- <s>Removed due to difficulty in obtaining accurate data when the face is not visible.</s>

#### 5. Email Verification Feature Added (2024-04-16)

- Added a feature to verify the user's email address to enhance security. Email verification helps confirm the user's identity and protect access to the account.

#### 6. Exercise Data Storage Feature Added (2024-05-02)

- Added a feature to store users' exercise data, allowing them to record and track their workouts.

#### 7. QR Code-based Exercise Data Transfer Feature Added (2024-05-13)

- Added a feature to easily transfer exercise data between users using QR codes. This allows users to easily share and compare workout results.

#### 8. HTTPS Usage (2024-05-19)

- Enhanced security by using HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for data transmission. HTTPS encrypts the data being transmitted, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping on the network.

#### 9. Load Balancer Usage (2024-05-25)

- Handled HTTPS traffic using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Load Balancer. The AWS Load Balancer manages SSL/TLS certificates and safely distributes traffic, improving both the availability and security of the application.

#### <s>10. IPv6 Usage (2024-05-31)</s>

- <s>Upgraded the network infrastructure to be future-oriented by adopting IPv6.</s> (Reverted to IPv4 due to issues with SSH connectivity.)
