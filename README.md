  <h2>Reason for Creation</h2>
  
  - <b>We offer a variety of genres and tempos of music tailored to users' diverse musical tastes and types of workouts.
    
  - <b>Workout Beats provides a feature that allows users to adjust the music according to their workout environment.
    
  - <b>Workout Beats should allow users to stream music in real-time. This requires technologies such as real-time data transmission and processing, buffering, and audio quality management to enhance user experience.

  <h2>Added part</h2>
1. Token Implementation
  
  - The reason for implementing tokens: 
Token-based registration is utilized to enhance authentication and security, facilitate stateless architecture, separate infrastructure components, improve user experience, and enable consistent authentication across applications.

1-2. Direct Implementation of Login and Sign-up Functionality

   - The reason for directly implementing the login and sign-up functionalities:
   I opted to implement the login and sign-up functionalities directly, without relying on frameworks like Spring Security, to deepen my understanding of the underlying concepts and operational principles.

   - By exploring various security and authentication techniques firsthand, I aimed to broaden my understanding of different technologies, contributing to making better decisions regarding technology stacks.
